# The English Open Word List
The EOWL is a free word list currently containing about 128,985 words.
The “English Open Word List” (EOWL) was developed by Ken Loge, but is
almost entirely derived from the “UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary”
(UKACD) Version 1.6, by J Ross Beresford. The original copyright
document for the UKACD can be found here.

As a developer of word games or spelling checkers you may find few
public domain word lists available that are well-maintained and
thorough. The “UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary” is an excellent and
comprehensive word list, but it isn’t particularly well-suited for
certain Scrabble™ style computer word games. I created the EOWL for this
purpose.

The EOWL currently contains about 128,985 words. To make EOWL more
usable for computer word games all words longer than 10 letters were
removed from the UKACD source list, and all proper nouns and words
requiring diacritical symbols, hyphens, and apostrophes were removed.
This makes it much like the standard ENABLE word list, but EOWL is
somewhat smaller (by 44,000 words or so) since it contains no words
longer than 10 characters. I separated the original single word list
document into 26 individual files to make it easier to work with and
added select words from the “Scrabble™ Players Dictionary, Third
Edition™ 1995, ISBN 0-87779-220-8.”

The current distribution of words for each letter in EOWL is listed
